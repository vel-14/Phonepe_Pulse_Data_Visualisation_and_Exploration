Phonepe Pulse Data Visualisation and Exploration.

The goal of this project is to make a tool that gets, cleans up, and shows data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub. Here's what it does:

Getting the Data: We use scripts to copy the GitHub info and gather data.

Fixing the Data: We use Python and Pandas to tidy up and organize the information.

Putting Data in a Database: We store the organized data in a MySQL database to keep it safe and easy to find.

Creating a Dashboard: We use Streamlit and Plotly to make a cool, interactive screen where you can see the data in a user-friendly way.

Getting Data Back: We set up a way to get the latest info from the database so the dashboard always shows the newest data.
